# PyData: Tensorflow Architecture

## Examples :
* **control_depdncs** : Way to synchronize access to Variable.
* **controlflow** : Some situations where Tensorflow doesn't follow Dataflow architecture.
* **constant** : Shows that tf.constant value stored in Graph definition unlike Variables.
* **serialization** : Shows how to serialize tf.Graph into specific protobuf.
* **tb** : Simple usage of Tensorboard with Lstm.
* **op** : Implementation of custom Op in Python.
